# DEVTASK task manager demo
![DEVTASK Demo]('demo/DEVTASK-demo.gif')

## Project description
DEVTASK is a react web application that allows the user to manage their workflow through a simple task management system. By keeping track with tasks in phases of creation, in-progress, and finished, the user has a clear view of what requires their focus. The application implements a clean design with a somewhat dark color scheme to avoid cluttering the UI with all the tasks at once as well as eye strain.

## Technologies
 - React (Javascript)
 - Redux (Redux-toolkit) - state mangement
 - LocalStorage (Redux-resist)
 - CSS  (Variables, Media queries, Flexbox, Grid)
 - Figma (Responsive design)
